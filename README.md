- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Piyusha!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things technology (yet to find my niche) but really want to focus on building software that makes an impact.
- ðŸŒ± My favorite course so far has been Data Structures and Algorithms and I'm excited to learn Relational Databases this Summer!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: shoot me a text on LinkedIn - www.linkedin.com/in/piyushasatija.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have recently taken up photography and really enjoy it! I can also finish a book (that I'm really into) within a few hours!
